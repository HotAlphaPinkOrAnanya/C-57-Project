        <p>My favourite dog is a husky as it is very fluffy and also has such mistical eyes some have grey eyes and some have blue ones and they are very costly but i really wish to buy it one day. But for now i will just say about it as you can see it has grey and white coat which is furry and it lives in cold climates and is also used as a sledge puller dog it can interact with humans (and is very adorable) they do well with children and do not need much food to survive but you have to keep them in cold climate otherwise they will die. There are soo many advantages of having this dog but for now i prefer my cute dog cookie :) he is very active and boastful and also very cute and lookes very much like a husky!  </p>
